# Instructions
To run the code make sure to correctly install all the packages as shown in requirements.txt. This can easily be done by running:
```
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
```
If using a custom environment, download the packages one by one. Run the notebook by the command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
And navigate to `abcn2.ipynb`.

If not using a Jupiter notebook, just open and run the python file instead.
